# C++ Projects

***

Contains C++ Projects / Files from various CS courses

**Rant(s)**
- c++ lacks a practical modular library / package system
  - Downloading libraries or files is barebones, I've had to download files and include the proper path poihnt to the file / directory in use cases
- Although `.hpp` is a legal header extension everyone seems to use `.h` which is mainly used in C. In my times at college so far this has been the go to convention which just makes no sense. It's so inefficient and requires more configuration. Why are people doing this? >.>
