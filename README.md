## C++ Caveats 😬

- C++ lacks a practical modular library / package system
  - Downloading libraries or packages is annoying and is not intuitive.
  - I tend to just download files manually and include them in my projects as necessary.

## C++ Newfound Wisdom 💭

- Some good stuff about **c++**
  - **c** like performance
  - Pointers and References 🔍📋
  - Decent backwards compatibility with **c**
- A redeeming quality of using **.h** for header files vs **.hpp** is the option for backwards compatibility with **c**.
  - Case in point however, if I were working on a project and do not forsee the need to use **c** I would would opt to use **.hpp** for header files, as is (in my opinion) proper convention as well as consistency.
