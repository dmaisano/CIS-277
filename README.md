# C++ Projects

***

Contains C++ Projects / Files from various CS courses

***

**Caveats 😬**
- C++ lacks a practical modular library / package system
  - Downloading libraries or packages feels super barebones, I've had to download files and source them in my projects.

**Newfound Wisdom 💭**
- Although I have known this for some time I'm just going to share a few good things about **C++**
  - C like performance
  - Pointers && References 🔍📋
  - C strings and other C structures/types
- A redeeming quality of using **.h** for header files vs **.hpp** is the backwards compatibility with **c** from what I'm aware.
  - Case in point however, if I were working on a project and do not see the need to use **c** I would stick to **.hpp** for header files, as is (in my opinion) proper convention.
