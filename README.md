# C++ Projects

***

Contains C++ Projects / Files from various CS courses

***

**Caveats 😬**
- C++ lacks a practical modular library / package system
  - Downloading libraries or packages feels super barebones, I've had to download files and source them in my projects.
- ~~Although `.hpp` is a legal header extension everyone seems to use `.h` which is mainly used in C. In my times at college so far this has been the go to convention which just makes no sense. All you lovers of C can grill me all you want!~~
  - ~~TLDR; `.cpp --> .hpp` please do this, it will make the world a better places.~~

**Newfound Wisdom 💭**
- Although I have known this for some time I'm just going to share a few good things about `C++`
  - C like performance
  - Pointers && References 🔍📋
  - C strings and other C structures/types
- A redeeming quality of using `.h` for header files vs `.hpp` is the backwards compatibility with `c` from what I'm aware.
  - Case in point however, if I were working on a project and do not see the need to use `c` I would stick to `.hpp` for header files, as is (in my opinion) proper convention.
