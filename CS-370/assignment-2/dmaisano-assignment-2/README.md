## How to run the program

To run the program you simply need to compile the java program and provide the path to the text file you will be providing as input to the program. See example below.

```sh
javac DavisPutnam.java && java DavisPutnam "input.txt" > "output.txt"
```

> note: the file redirection ">" is optional if you want to capture the output from stdout to a file
