// getVectorData() Pseudo:

getVectorData(parameters: container passed by ref)
START
-Initialize string to hold the current line of the file being read
-Open the file containing the vector data
-LOOP through each line
-Call splitData() function on each line to get the correct format of data
-End of LOOP
-Close the file
END


// deleteVector() Pseudo:

deleteVector(parameters: container passed by ref)
START
-Initialize int for userInput
-LOOP through each vector stored in the container
-Display each vector in the container with a corresponding number
-End of LOOP
-Prompt the user to enter the number of the vector to delete
-Delete the vector
-Call menu() function to go back to main menu
END


// splitData() Pseudo:

splitData(parameters: container passed by ref, string line)
START
-Initialize a VECTOR type (contains a name, x, & y)
-Split up the current line of the file into words
-LOOP through each word
-If the word/line is empty ignore it
-Assign the first word to the VECTOR name value
-Assign the second word to the VECTOR x value
-Assign the third word to the VECTOR y value
-Push the VECTOR created to the appropriate container
-End of LOOP

// writeVectorData() Pseudo:

writeVectorData(parameters: container passed by ref)
START
-Open a file & delete contents of file
-LOOP through each VECTOR in the container
-Write each VECTOR within the container separated by a comma
-At the end of the VECTOR within the current container add a new line to the file
-End of LOOP

// printVector() Pseudo:

printVector(parameters: container passed by ref)
START
-LOOP through each VECTOR in the container
-Print out the VECTOR name, VECTOR x value, & VECTOR y value
-End of LOOP
-Call menu() function to go back to main menu
END


// menu() Pseudo:

menu()
START
-Initialize a container to hold the VECTOR types
-Initialize an integer to hold the userâ€™s input
-Call getVectorData() function to get any existing data if a file already exists
-LOOP through the menu until user decides to exit program
-Display all options available
-Prompt user to select from the options provided
-Get user input
-If there are VECTORs in an existing file, show option to print the VECTORs in file
-If the user enters 0, call printVector() function
-If the user enters 1, call createVector() function
-If the user enters 2, call deleteVector() function
-If the user enters 3, call calcSum() function
-If the user enters 4, call calcDiff() function
-If the user enters 5, call scalarMultiple() function
-If the user enters 6, call multVect() function
-If the user enters 7, call multVect() function
-If the user enters -1, exit the program
