### types of growths

- **exponential** (fast growth): b<sup>n</sup> for some b > 1

- **polynomial** (balanced): a<sub>0</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>n + a<sub>2</sub>n<sup>2</sup> + . . . + a<sub>d</sub>n<sup>d</sup>

- **polylogarithmic** (slow growth): lg(n)<sup>k</sup>

- **iterated log** (really slow growth): lg\*(n) = number of times needed to apply the lg function to get a result <= 1.

### notation

- Notation for comparing growh rate of functions; Given 2 positive functions of positive integer arguments **f(n), g(n)**.

- We say that **f(n) is "big oh" of g(n)**, and write **f(n) = O(g(n))**, if there exists a positive number c and n<sub>0</sub> such that **f(n) <= c \* g(n) for all n >= n<sub>0</sub>**

- We say that **f(n) is "little oh" of g(n)**, written **f(n) = o(g(n))** if for _any_ c > 0, there exists n<sub>0</sub> such that **n >= n<sub>0</sub>** implies that **f(n) <= c \* g(n)**.

  - Basically f(n) is smaller than g(n).

<!-- TODO: f(n) table pic here -->

### polynomial

- Let **f** be a polynomial of degree **d** and **g** be a polynomial of degree **k**.

#### example(s)

- f(n) = 7 + 3n<sup>2</sup> + 8n<sup>5</sup>

  - f(n) = o(n<sup>6</sup>)

- f(n) = O(g(n))

  - "f is a member of the _class_ of functions that are asy. bounded by positive multiple(s) of g"
